# Deformable DETR introduces a deformable attention module based on DETR to achieve an efficient and fast object detection mechanism. However, effectively perceiving the contours of complex structured objects and small targets remains a key challenge in visual recognition. To meet these requirements, this article proposes a new attention mechanism, DDA (Dynamic Deformable Attention), built on Deformable DETR. DDA improves granularity perception by 8 times compared to Deformable DETR and enhances perception ability of target contours and small targets in complex environments. Numerous experiments have demonstrated its effectiveness on the COCO2017 dataset benchmark. Additionally, the attention mechanism can more effectively recognize small targets. Compared to Deformable DETR, DDA has increased its detection metric (APS) for small targets by 1.2 %.
